This is my first webpage.

I created it locally using Wordpress and PHP, but decided to test it first as a static webpage here on Github, so it's no longer dynamic.
All of the PHP codes were translated into static content via "Simply Static" plugin in WordPress Admin. 
This is a custom WordPress theme made from scratch. SVG and PNG pictures were edited by me in Adobe Illustrator and were vectorized (if they weren't already).
The theme's colors and decorations were inspired by a PowerPoint theme creator named Mirjam Nilsson and her design and templates called "Floral Flourish".
